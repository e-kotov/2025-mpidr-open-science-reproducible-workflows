First, make sure you got [familiar with how Docker containers work](3a-how-docker-and-binder-work.qmd).

::: {.callout-warning}
This task can only be done on your own computer.

For this tutorial you cannot use the [Play with Docker Labs Environment](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/){target="_blank"}, you can only follow along on your own computer, if you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/){target="_blank"}, [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/download){target="_blank"} (recommended alternative for `macOS`), or other Docker-compatible software installed. Using the `Play with Docker Labs` environment is free and does not require any installation, only a web browser and a Docker Hub account, but the compute nodes they provide are limited in size and do not allow to build large container images, which in this case is essential. You can however experiment with a smaller container image 
:::

# The Goal

Build your own Docker container image with the packages we require for the project built-into it. You can continue with your own project or you can reuse our snapshot of the expected results of the section 2 exercise on setting up a simple `targets` pipeline located at [https://github.com/e-kotov/2025-mpidr-workflows-reference-02](https://github.com/e-kotov/2025-mpidr-workflows-reference-02){target="_blank"}.

We are doing this for the scenario of preserving the environment of the original code in order to share the complete container image as a file that is completely self-contained including the operating system (`Ubuntu (Linux)` in this case), all system dependencies, `R` packages required for the analysis and even the `RStudio` IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

# Instructions

## Choose the Rocker Image version

Go to [Rocker Project's Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial/tags){target="_blank"} and find an appropriate version of the `RStudio` image. Since we are using modern R version and no trying to recreate an environment for an older version of R back from 2020, you can just use the most recent container image.

::: {.callout-note}
If you wanted to reconstruct the environment from several years ago, we would advice to also use the `R` version that was used then, like we did in the [repository](https://github.com/e-kotov/demographic-research.44-19-containerized){target="_blank"} where we recreated `R` 4.2.2 from 2022 to run Jonas's old code.
:::


::: {.callout-tip}
If you want to figure things out on your own and adpat the existing code you can look at our `Dockerfile` in the repository for Jonas's old code at [https://github.com/e-kotov/demographic-research.44-19-containerized/blob/main/Dockerfile4build/Dockerfile](https://github.com/e-kotov/demographic-research.44-19-containerized/blob/main/Dockerfile4build/Dockerfile){target="_blank"}. Otherwise, continue following the steps below.
:::

## Create the `Dockerfile`

Create an empty text file called `Dockerfile` in a new folder `Dockerfile4build`.

The first line for the `Dockerfile` should be the instruction on which existing `Docker` container image to use. For the most recent `Rocker Geospatial` image, you can use the following code:

```dockerfile
FROM rocker/geospatial:4.4.3
```

Next, we need to create a temporary project in the container image, so that we could use it to activate `{renv}` and install the packages.

```dockerfile
RUN mkdir -p /home/rstudio/project && \ 
    chown -R rstudio:rstudio /home/rstudio/project
WORKDIR /home/rstudio/project
```

We also need to copy the `{renv}`-specific files into the container image.

```dockerfile
COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio ../renv.lock renv.lock
RUN mkdir -p renv
COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio ../.Rprofile .Rprofile
COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio ../renv/activate.R renv/activate.R
COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio ../renv/settings.json renv/settings.json
```

Finally, we need to run `R` within the container image to install the packages.

```dockerfile
RUN R -e "renv::restore(library = '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library')"
```

::: {.callout-note}
Let us break down the most recent line in the `Dockerfile`:

  - `R` - starts `R`
  
  - `-e` - executes the command that follows next

  - `renv::restore(library = '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library')` - installs the packages listed in the `renv.lock` file. The trick here is that we are installing the packages into the system library, which is `/usr/local/lib/R/site-library`, instead of a project library. This way, the packages will be integrated into the container image and will be seen by an R session. When you later connect your project folder to this container image, you will not need to install the packages or use `{renv}` anymore (in fact, you will need to deactivate `{renv}`).
:::

Now we also remove the temporary project folder from the container image:

```dockerfile
RUN chmod -R u+w /home/rstudio/project && rm -rf /home/rstudio/project
```

And finally we reuse the lines that instruct `Docker` how to run the container image [from the original `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/blob/abe4fc1f3fb1c50281f9de5b3636f8a117126f98/dockerfiles/geospatial_4.4.3.Dockerfile#L39-L40){target="_blank"}:

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 8787
CMD ["/init"]
```

This exposes the port `8787` (on which the `RStudio Sever`, which is actually the thing that you see as the `RStudio` in the web browser, runs) so that you would be able to access it at `http://localhost:8787` in a web browser.

Remember to save the changes.

So your final `Dockerfile` should look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM rocker/geospatial:4.4.3

RUN mkdir -p /home/rstudio/project && \ 
    chown -R rstudio:rstudio /home/rstudio/project
WORKDIR /home/rstudio/project

COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio ../renv.lock renv.lock
RUN mkdir -p renv
COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio ../.Rprofile .Rprofile
COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio ../renv/activate.R renv/activate.R
COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio ../renv/settings.json renv/settings.json

RUN R -e "renv::restore(library = '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library')"

RUN chmod -R u+w /home/rstudio/project && rm -rf /home/rstudio/project
```

### Build the Docker Container Image

::: {.callout-note}
For the following commands to work, you need to start the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/){target="_blank"} application on your computer. For `macOS` you can use [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/download){target="_blank"} instead.
:::

To build the `Docker` container image from the `Dockerfile`, run the following command in the terminal (you can use any name instead of `rocker-443-custom` - this is just a tag that you can use to refer to the container image later):

``` bash
docker build -f Dockerfile4build/Dockerfile -t rocker-443-custom .
```

If you are on `macOS` on a recent `arm64` (Apple Silicon) chip, you will need to add an extra parameter to build this container image, as it is intended to be of a `x86_64` processor architecture:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile4build/Dockerfile -t rocker-443-custom .
```

The container image will take about 3-6 minutes to build.



Let us break down this command:

| part of command          | what it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `docker build`           | This is the base command used to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `--platform linux/amd64`           | This is a parameter that is only needed on `macOS` on a recent `arm64` (Apple Silicon) chip. It is intended to build the container image for a `x86_64` processor architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `-f Dockerfile4build/Dockerfile`           | The `-f` flag stands for "file". `Dockerfile4build/Dockerfile` is the path to the Dockerfile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-t rocker-443-custom` | The `-t` flag stands for "tag". `rocker-443-custom` is the name of the image. You can choose any other name. |
| `.`                      | this very important `.` (dot) specifies the build context, which is the current directory. Docker will look for a `Dockerfile` in this directory to create the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |


When the build is finished, you can check that it was added to the local container image storage:

``` bash
docker images
```

### Run the Docker Container from your Image

Now you have a container image that you can run from the command line. To do so, run the following command in the terminal:

``` bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --rm -p 8787:8787 -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio -e PASSWORD=somepass rocker-443-custom
```

Let us break down this command:

| part of command                      | what it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `docker run`                         | This is the base command used to run a Docker container from local or remote container image storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `--platform linux/amd64`                         | This is a parameter that is only needed on `macOS` on a recent `arm64` (Apple Silicon) chip. It is intended to build the container image for a `x86_64` processor architecture..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `--rm`                               | This makes the container temporary. It will be destroyed after you stop it. You can explore other options (e.g. how to name containers, make them persistent and re-run the same ones after stopping) in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). But for now we want a disposable container that is destroyed after stopping.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `-p 8787:8787`                       | This flag specifies that the port inside the container is mapped to your computer, so that you can access RStudio in a web browser. Briefly, RStudio in a container is actually a server software that works over a network and it is not exactly the same as RStudio on your laptop, even though it feels that way. This is why ports are necessary, but do not worry about it too much at the moment.                                                                                                                                           |
| `-v $(pwd):/home/rstudio` | This maps the current directory (designated by `$(pwd)`) from which you are running the command to a folder inside the container (`/home/rstudio`). Thanks to this, when you use the containerized RStudio, you will have access to your local folder and will be able to run scripts and edit them. Instead of the current directory (designated by `$(pwd)`) you can provide `/path/to/any/folder/on/your/computer`. |
| `-e PASSWORD=somepass`               | Sets the password. Better use a good password, even though you are running locally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `rocker-443-custom`                | The final part is the name and tag that you assigned earlier when you were creating the container image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The container starts almost instantly. You can now open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8787` and use the password you set. The username is `rstudio`, the password is `somepass`.

Once it is loaded, you will see the message in R console:

```r
# Bootstrapping renv 1.1.1 ---------------------------------------------------
- Downloading renv ... OK
- Installing renv  ... OK

- Project '~/' loaded. [renv 1.1.1]
- One or more packages recorded in the lockfile are not installed.
- Use `renv::status()` for more details.
```

Please ignore it, and just run:

```r
renv::deactivate()
```

::: {.callout-warning}
`renv::deactivate()` will remove the line that activates `renv` from the `.Rprofile` file, or even remove the file entirely if this was the only line in it. This will happen in your project folder on your computer, because we have attached the project folder to the container image. So to reactivate `renv`, you need to run `renv::activate()` later.
:::

The `R` session will automatically restart and you will have access to all the packages we have previously snapshotted and installed into the container. So you can run `targets::tar_visnetwork()` and `targets::tar_make()`.

::: {.callout-warning}
In this scenario, when you edit the files from within the container, because you have attached the project folder to the container image, the changes will be saved to the files in the project folder on your computer.
:::

### Stop the container

To stop the container, click the "power" button in the top right corner of the `RStudio` window in the browser. Close the web browser tab with `RStudio`. Click in the terminal and press `Ctrl+C` or `Ctrl+\` to stop the container.

You should see:

```bash
[s6-finish] waiting for services.
[s6-finish] sending all processes the TERM signal.
[s6-finish] sending all processes the KILL signal and exiting.
```

And then the terminal will be active again.
